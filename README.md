## 🎨 About the Project

This was my **first attempt at creating a 2D animation**, completed as part of a self-learning journey.  
While animation is **not my primary field**, I enjoyed exploring storytelling through motion.

The goal was to practice visual creativity and learn the basics of character movement, timing, and sound syncing.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This animation may contain **rough transitions, glitches, or quality issues**.
- It was created for **personal growth and learning**.
- As a cybersecurity student/professional, I do not actively work in animation — this was purely experimental and exploratory.

Please view it with that context in mind.
